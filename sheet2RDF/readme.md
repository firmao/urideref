pip install pandas rdflib openpyxl


 steps:

Access the Google Spreadsheet: You'll need to use the Google Sheets API to access the spreadsheet's data.

Prepare RDF: We'll use Python's rdflib library to create RDF triples.

Namespaces and Vocabularies: Use SKOS and a custom namespace from the DataMethods.ttl file.

Generate URIs: We'll use w3id to generate stable URIs.

Convert Spreadsheet Data: We'll take the spreadsheet rows and convert them to RDF triples using SKOS and the custom vocab.

Explanation:
Google Sheets Access:
Uses gspread and oauth2client to access Google Sheets. You need to authenticate using the credentials JSON file.
RDF Generation:
rdflib is used to build an RDF graph.
We define custom namespaces including https://w3id.org/ for URIs and the custom DataMethods namespace from the DataMethods.ttl.
Data Transformation:
Each row from the spreadsheet is treated as a concept.
Basic RDF triples are created using the data from columns like ID, Label, Description, and BroaderTerm.
SKOS properties like skos:prefLabel and skos:broader are used to represent the data semantically.
Output:
The resulting RDF triples are serialized to a Turtle file (output.rdf).
Customization:
Modify the script to match your spreadsheet's structure, such as changing column names (e.g., ID, Label, Description).
Adjust the URIs and namespaces as needed.
Ensure you have the appropriate API credentials and that the spreadsheet is correctly formatted for RDF conversion.
